      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        This app is a tool for calculating the global minimum or maximum of a
        function. It uses the algorithms of the following types:
        <b>random search</b>, <b>evolutionary</b>, <b>swarm</b> and
        <b>gradient</b>. The user can choose one or more algorithms and
        functions. The app will calculate the global minimum (or maximum) of the
        function using the chosen algorithms. The user can also upload new
        function(s) and algorithm(s) in .DLL files.
